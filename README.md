# YouTube Comments & Popularity Analysis
My goal is to uncover what kinds of videos drive more engagement, what comment patterns appear for high-performing videos, and how sentiment relates to popularity. These insights are geared towards content creators or platform strategists.

# Dataset and Schema


# Business Questions
1. Which keywords are associated with the highest-performing videos?

2. Do videos with high engagement (likes/views/comments) tend to have more positive, negative, or neutral comments?

3. Use average sentiment across comments per video.

4. Which videos have the most liked comments, and what is the sentiment of those top comments?

5. What proportion of videos have disabled comments or hidden like counts?

6. Are there keywords that consistently result in higher comment sentiment or more liked comments?

7. How does the publication date relate to performance?
